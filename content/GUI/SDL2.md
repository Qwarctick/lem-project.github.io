The SDL2 backend of Lem adds images and graphics support. You can draw at any location on a specified buffer or window.

## Mouse actions

This version also adds mouse support. Mouse clicks allow some actions:

- a **middle mouse click** inserts an S-expression at the cursor position,
- a **double click** or triple click selects S-expressions.

The directory mode handles clicks on files and directories.
