title: Markdown mode
---

Lem's markdown mode supports syntax highlihgting and the followning additional features.

## Default keybindings

- `C-c C-l`: `markdown-insert-link`.

## Syntax highlighting of code block in markdown-mode

> This feature is available since May 25th, 2024.

When you start a code block with three backticks and a programming
language name, the code block will be highlighted for this
language. You don't have to activate anything.

## Brewing features

- indentation within code blocks and their mode-specific features are
  future work.
- interactive evaluation of code blocks is a work in progress ([#1304](https://github.com/lem-project/lem/pull/1304)).
