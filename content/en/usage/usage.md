The documentation is in progress. You can find a list of available keys and commands in [keybindings](/lem-page/usage/keybindings/), and you can get this list in Lem itself with `M-x documentation-describe-bindings` (new after Lem 2.0).


# Lem Manual for Users

Lem has Emacs-like keybindings, as well as a vi emulation (`M-x vi-mode`).

So, to open a file, press `C-x C-f` (you get the file selection dialog shown above). To save it, it's `C-x C-s`. To save many buffers at once, use `C-x s`.

To switch windows (aka splits of a screen): `C-x o` ('o' letter) and `M-o`. To make a window fullscreen: `C-x 1`. To split it vertically: `C-x 3` and horizontally: `C-x 2`. To make the current window disappear: `C-x 0` (zero).

To switch buffers: `C-x b`.

To run an interactive command by name: `M-x` (`alt-x`).

To show the context menu: `Shift-F10`.

Quit Lem with `C-x C-c`.

## Opening files

As said above, the shortcut to open a file is `C-x C-f` (aka `M-x
find-file`). This presents a dialog to choose a file, with
autocompletion, starting at the buffer's directory. We can also search
for files in a **project** or recursively in **subdirectories**.

You can open a file in another "window", aka if Lem's screen is split in two, open the file in the other screen. Use `C-x 4 f` (`M-x find-file-other-window`). This splits the screen vertically if needed.

You can then resize the windows. Look for the "shrink-" and "grow-" commands.

### Filer - project explorer

> This feature was added after Lem 2.0

The shortcut `C-x d` opens a project explorer on the left side. Another keypress closes the Filer.

### Find file in project

> Project related commands were added after Lem 2.0

Use `M-x project-find-file` to choose a file among the list of all files pertaining to the current project. This command is bound to `C-x p f`.

A project is recognized by typical files or directories. For example,
a directory containing a `.git/` subdirectory or a `.project`,
`.projectile`, `.ignore`, `configure.ac` or `Makefile` file is
considered the root of a project. The actual list is a bit longer, it should "just work".

When you call the `project-find-file` command, Lem looks at the
buffer's working directory if it recognizes a project root. If not, it
goes up one directory and looks again, and continually until finding a
project root. It stops at the home directory.

If no project root was found, Lem uses the buffer's directory.

There are also the commands:

| Command | Key-combination | Function                                                        |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `project-delete-buffers` | `C-x p K` | delete all this project's buffers                    |
| `project-root` |                     | display the project root         |
| `project-find-file-other-window` | `C-x 4 p f` | open a file in another window              |
| `project-root-directory` | `C-x p d` | open the project root with Lem's directory-mode      |
| `project-root-directory-other-window` |  | open the project root in another window          |

These commands allow to **switch** between projects:

| Command | Key-combination | Function                                                        |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `project-save` | `C-x p s` | save the current project. This populates the text file on `(lem-home)/history/projects`. |
| `project-switch` |`C-x p p`| choose a saved project and find a file in it |
| `project-unsave` |`C-x p u`| remove a project from the history            |


Configuration:

- for `project-delete-buffers`:
  - if `*delete-repl-buffer*` is non t, we don't delete the REPL buffer.
  - if `*delete-last-buffer*` is non nil, we will delete the last buffer. This would cause Lem to exit.


The **filer** (`C-x d`, see above) opens the project root.

The project's file chooser will try to use the `fdfind` program to list the
project files. In that case, common development directories such as
`.git/` and `node_modules/` will be excluded. Read more below.


### Find file recursively

> find-file-recursively was added after Lem 2.0

The command `find-file-recursively` is not bound to a key by default. This command opens a selection prompt and lists all files under the buffer's directory, recursively, letting you choose and open a file deep in the directory tree quickly.

<img class="" src="/lem-page/find-file-recursively.png" alt="">

> Note: contrary to `project-find-file`, it starts the search at the buffer's directory, not at the project root.

The method to search all files recursively is configurable. Lem first tries with any of these external programs: `fd`, `fdfind` (which is `fd` installed from Debian repositories) and `find` (the Unix find). If none of these programs exist, it falls back to a Lisp version.

[fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) is an external tool, that is fast and that filters out some directories by default: "node_modules/", ".git/" and such. The Lisp method doesn't exclude them.

But what happens if you call this command on your HOME, or in a directory with lots and lots of files? The command has a 5 seconds timeout (by default). After that time, the process is aborted and Lem uses the simpler `find-file` command.

### Configuration

You can bind the command to a keybinding:

~~~lisp
(lem:define-key lem:*global-keymap* "C-x F" 'lem-core/commands/file:find-file-recursively)
~~~

The variables and methods are inside the Lisp package `:lem-core/commands/file`.

You can change the order of the finder programs:

~~~lisp
;; these must be keywords, not strings.
(setf *find-programs* (list :fdfind :fd :find :lisp))
~~~

or choose the one to use:

~~~lisp
(setf *find-program* :lisp)
~~~

You can change the timeout:

~~~lisp
(setf *find-program-timeout* 5)
~~~

and change the behaviour of the methods that return the list of files
and directories. They are written as CLOS generic methods specializing
on the `*find-program*` keyword, so you can use `:before`, `:around`
or `:after` qualifiers.

~~~lisp
(defmethod get-files-recursively :around ((finder (eql :lisp)))
  (let ((results (call-next-method)))
     (do-something-with-the-results)))
~~~


## Switching buffers

Use `C-x b` (aka `M-x list-buffers`). But don't stop here, it's a rich command.

You are presented a "modale" window. Type some text to start narrowing the buffers list matching your entry.

You can also use Space to select/deselect entries, then use a right click to choose an action to apply on the selected buffers. Default actions are to kill the selected buffers, or to save them.

### Tabs

Lem has a rudimentary support for tabs as for now.

Activate the tab bar with `M-x toggle-tabbar`. This shows a tab for every buffer.

On the GUI version of Lem, you can click on them.

### Workspaces

Lem has a frame multiplexer, aka "workspaces" or "screen
manager".

This feature allows to create many workspaces, or screen
configurations, on the same Lem instance. We can create a new
workspace, open buffers and arrange the window as we like (split
vertically, horizontallyâ€¦), and switch to another workspace where the
window arrangement and the displayed buffers are different.

The frame multiplexer bindings start with `C-z`:

| Command | Key-combination | Function                                                        |
|:-------:|:-------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `frame-multiplexer-create-with-new-buffer-list` | `C-z c` | create a new workspace          |
| `frame-multiplexer-next` | `C-z n`              | go to the next workspace         |
| `frame-multiplexer-prev` | `C-z p`              | go to the previous workspace     |
| `frame-multiplexer-delete` | `C-z d`            | delete the current workspace     |
| `toggle-frame-multiplexer` |                    | enable or disable (and loose) all workspaces     |


## vi and emacs modes

Use `M-x vi-mode` and `M-x emacs-mode`.

You can also start Lem in any given, see the configuration section.

## Auto-completion (abbrev)

Lem has a system of *abbreviation* that permits to auto-complete any
text that was previously entered in any text buffer.

By default, `abbrev` is bound to `M-/`

In vi's insert-mode, it is also bound to `C-p`.

There is also the command `abbrev-with-popup-window` that shows the list of completion candidates. It is not bound by default. We can bind it to a key:

~~~lisp
;; C-n is originally bound to next-line.
(define-key *global-keymap* "C-n" 'lem/abbrev:abbrev-with-pop-up-window)
~~~

and in vi-mode:

~~~lisp
;; C-n is originally bound to next-line.
(define-key lem-vi-mode:*insert-keymap* "C-n" 'lem/abbrev:abbrev-with-pop-up-window)
~~~


## Describe keys

To know what function is bound to a key binding, use `C-x ?` (`M-x describe-key`).

## Describe and list available bindings

To see the available key bindings in the current keymap, use `M-x describe-bindings`.

You can use `M-x describe-mode` to understand in which mode the editor is in the current buffer.

You can do more and *list all Lem's existing keybindings* with `M-x documentation-describe-bindings`. It inspects Lem and lists keybindings, grouped by modes:

- move, edit, mark, word, S-expressions, file, buffer, window, multiple-cursors, process, help, font and other.

**Note:** this command was added after Lem 2.0.

## grep

    M-x grep

this presents the results in a two-panes window. You can edit lines in the results buffer, changes are reflected immediately on the files, and updated on the right side. You can use search and replace `M-x query-replace` in the results buffer.

## multiple cursors

Use `M-C` (Alt and capital c), `M-x add-cursors-to-next-line` to add a cursor to the next line.

## Misc

Try:

- `M-x toggle-line-numbers`
  - or `(lem/line-numbers:toggle-line-numbers)`
- `M-x toggle-read-only`
  - `(lem-core/commands/buffer:toggle-read-only)`
- `M-x toggle-auto-save`
  - `(lem/auto-save:toggle-auto-save)`
- `M-x toggle-frame-fullscreen`

Set a transparent background with this line in your init file:

    (sdl2-ffi.functions:sdl-set-window-opacity (lem-sdl2::display-window lem-sdl2::*display*) 0.9)
